Hitters dataset

1) Split data into training and test
2) Fit model with linear Regression
3) Compute training and test RMSE
4) Conduct test for assumptions (multicollinearity, breush-pagan and non-linearity)
5) Try and fix for voilations found

Wage Dataset

1) Just take the Wage (Y) and Age (X) variables
2) Fit model with linear Regression
3) Compute training and test RMSE
4) Test for non-linearity
5) Fix for non-linearity
6) Recheck test rmse - you should see an improvement
